UNC-CH_DA - Module 15 Challenge - leaflet-challenge
* Andrew Bourgeois

## **INSTRUCTIONS**

* To visit the deployed app for Part 1 in GitHub Pages:
* Currenlty as of (02 OCT 2023, 14:00ET) only Part 1 is fully completed, Part 2 will be completed as time permits.
* The code for PArt 1 can be found in the folder marked Leaflet Part 1

## **ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE**

* I have begun the additional challenge but sadly, time constraints due to Project 3 being due as well, limited my time for non-andatory exercises.
* I have begun the process of adding the code for Part 2, but it currently remains UNFINISHED.

## **BACKGROUND**

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## **REQUIREMENTS**

### **These requirements apply only to "Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization" as "Part 2" is optional with no extra points earning.**

## **Map (60 points)**

* TileLayer loads without error (20 points)

* Connects to geojson API using D3 without error (20 points)

* Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude (10 points)

* A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color (10 points)

## **Data Points (40 points)**

* Data points scale with magnitude level (10 points)

* Data points colors change with depth level (10 points)

* Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth (10 points)

* All data points load in the correct locations (10 points)

## **RESOURCES**

* Used MAC Color seelector tool determine gauge colors frome exercise reference image.

* RGB to hex converter: https://www.rgbtohex.net/

* Dataset created by the United States Geological Survey

* Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplatesLinks to an external site.
